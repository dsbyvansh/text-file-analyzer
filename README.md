# Text File Analyzer

Ever wondered what's really inside your text files?  
The **Text File Analyzer** is a simple Python program I made that takes any `.txt` file and gives you some quick, useful stats:

- How many lines it has
- How many words you’ve written
- Total characters (including spaces)
- The average word length
- Which words you use the most

It’s lightweight, easy to run, and doesn’t need any extra libraries — just Python.

## What it can do
- Works with any plain `.txt` file.
- Counts lines, words, and characters accurately.
- Finds the most common words in the file.
- Calculates the average word length.
- No setup headaches — just run it.

## How to use it

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/text-file-analyzer.git
   cd text-file-analyzer
2. Run the Script:
   python main.py sample.txt
3. Example output:
   The number of characters in the given file are: 58
    The number of words in the given file are: 12
    The number of sentences in the given file are: 3
    The most common word in the file is: Python
    The average sentence length in the given file is: 19.333333333333332
    


Want to improve it?
  I’d love to see what you can add.
  Here are some ideas:
  Count sentences and paragraphs.
  Estimate reading time.
  Show results as a chart or graph.
  Fork the repo, make your changes, and open a pull request.

Why I made this: 
  This started as a small practice project for Python file handling, but it turned out to be pretty handy.
  It’s simple enough for beginners but can be expanded into something much bigger.
